# Cinema-booking-system
It's a simple and small command-line cinema booking management system created by Python.The system handles two different profiles: the cinema employee and ordinary customers. Both types of users need to login before being able to use the management system.

Employee system:

1.The cinema employee is able to login to the cinema management system using a username/password pair. Please use [username: staff password: 123] in my system.

2.The cinema employee can add films with their respective dates and screening times. A film is represented by a title and a brief description.

3.For a given film/date/time, an up-to-date room setting is provided. Booked seats and available ones are distinguished by black square white square.

4.The cinema employee can logout from the application.

Customer system:

1.I created 2 users for customer: [username: Simon password: 123], [username: Russell password: 456], you can use any of them to log in customer system.

2.After login, a customer can update his/her profile to use for future bookings. The profile is composed of email address and phone number in my application. There is also booking history that is updated automatically when the user makes a booking or delete an existing one.

3.Customer can pick up a date, get a list of films available on the selected date with their respective information and available screening times.

4.The customer can book a seat (for a given film/date/time)

5.When booking is confirmed, a summary of his booking will be displayed and the booking added to his history.

6.A customer can delete an existing booking from his list if it is a future booking only, otherwise an error message is displayed.

7.The cinema customer can logout from the application.
